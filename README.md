[Santhiya Pothi](https://giansingh4710.github.io/learnGurmukhi/)

There are many apps out there that are avaliable for reading Gurbani.
The only thing in this app is that it is focused on santhiya. It doesn't
include the nitnem baniya because thoese are readaliy avaliable (also, each bani added will
make the size of the app grow becuase I'm using pdfs to show the baniya). Im using pdfs also
because some people prefere reading from them instead of regular gutke apps becuase
it makes it feel more like the physical pothi sahib. If you can read from a physical pothi sahib that is definetly the best. This is just another alternitive
