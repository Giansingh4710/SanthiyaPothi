[Santhiya Pothi](https://santhiyapothi.xyz)

There are many apps out there that are avaliable for reading Gurbani(The Sikh Scriptures).
The only thing in this app is that it is focused on santhiya(a method of learning to read Gurbani).
In this app you will also be able to upload your own pdfs so you have add other texts
and scriptures. Currently the app is being developed and tested. The current link that is
given is the watered down web verion of the app. The app is being built with React-Native
so it should be avaliable on IOS and Andriod soon.
